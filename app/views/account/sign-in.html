      <p>People on the children’s barred list are not allowed to work with children.</p>
      <p>The list is usually checked as part of a new employee’s enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.</p>
      <p>Schools, colleges, local authorities and higher education institutions can check the children’s barred list separately if the new employee either:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>will start working with children while waiting for the result of an enhanced DBS check</li>
        <li>does not need an enhanced DBS check because they’ve worked with children in a school or college within the last 3 months</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You’ll need the new employee’s last name and date of birth to check the children’s barred list.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
<p>You need a DfE Sign-in account. If you do not have one then you can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>ask your organisation’s approver to create an account for you</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us">contact form</a> to request an account if you do not have an approver</li>
</ul>

      <form method="post">
        {{ govukButton({
          text: "Start now",
          isStartButton: true
        }) }}
