{#
Schools, colleges, local authorities and universities can use this search to check the children's barred list status of individuals who they are
considering engaging in regulated activity. This search should only be used to check the barred list status of a new starter pending the receipt
of an Enhanced DBS or where an individual has worked in post in a school or college that brought them into regular contact with children or
young persons which ended not more than three months prior to that person's appointment to the organisation. If a potential match is
returned please contact DBS via email dbscost@dbs.gov.uk. Please note this check is only permitted for those entitled to ask an exempted
question under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. #}
